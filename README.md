Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. 
There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges,

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers,
